\fs26 A webmaster is someone who maintains and controls a website. Webmaster\'92s can have many roles. A role I found to be the most and interesting is designing the website they maintain. They design the website to be functional and they make it appealing to customers and visitors. It is important to do this so people don\'92t get frustrated by a non-functional website.\
	I am interested in this role because I love designing and creating things. Usually, I take my time on things and try to make them perfect. You would need to take time to make a website perfect and you would need to update it a lot. A webmaster is a career that is a necessity for a website to be functional. \
